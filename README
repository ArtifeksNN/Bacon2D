A simple Qt-based 2D game engine.

========
1. Build
========

1.1) Dependencies

* Qt5
  	Qt5 source repository: https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5

1.2) Building

Available QMake parameters:

* QTPATH (Optional)
	Prefix where Qt has been installed. It is required to install
	Bacon2D's QML import plugin and related files.
	The default path is /usr/lib/qt5

Sample build from Bacon2D's root source tree:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ qmake QTPATH=/opt/Qt5 ..
$ make
$ sudo make install


===========
2. Examples
===========

If you have installed the QML plugin to the proper Qt import directory,
you can run the examples directly from their specific source directories.

Each example can be opened and run from QtCreator, to open the fixtures 
example, open examples/fixtures/fixtures.qmlproject from QtCreator

To run the fixtures example without QtCreator:

$ cd examples/fixtures
$ qmlscene main.qml

If Bacon2D QML plugin was not installed you can export QML2_IMPORT_PATH 
environment variable or specify the path to your built plugin on 
the command line.

$ cd examples/fixtures
$ qmlscene -I ../../build/src/imports main.qml
